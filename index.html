          <p class="2xl:leading-loose text-xl mb-4">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not
            more so,
            in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</p>

          <p class="2xl:leading-loose text-white/70">‚ÄúI was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve
            been
            looking to make
            a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.‚Äù</p>

            Getting guidance
            from them and
            learning from their experiences was easy.</p>

          <p class="2xl:leading-loose text-white/70">‚ÄúThe staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find
            really refreshing.
            The program
            gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
            an incredible community of smart and amazing people.‚Äù</p>

          <p class="2xl:leading-loose text-gray/70">‚ÄúBefore joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I
            needed some
            structure from
            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
            could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
            100% recommend!‚Äù</p>
